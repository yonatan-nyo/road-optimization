## Description
🚧 **Road Network Optimization using Graph Theory** 🌐  

This repository contains the implementation and analysis for optimizing road networks by applying graph theory algorithms. The project models geographical and travel distances between nodes to identify the most efficient connections, minimizing travel time across a given area.  

### Key Features:  
- 📍 **Graph Modeling** – Nodes represent locations, and edges represent roads with associated travel costs.  
- 🚗 **Shortest Path Analysis** – Utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest paths between nodes.  
- 📏 **Distance Calculation** – Implements the Haversine formula to calculate geographical distances between nodes.  
- 🔍 **Efficiency Insights** – Determines the most strategic new connections to prioritize road construction and resource allocation.  
- 📊 **Visualization & Results** – Outputs routes, costs, and distance metrics for comprehensive analysis.  

### Use Cases:  
- Urban planning and infrastructure development  
- Transportation system optimization  
- Resource-efficient project planning  

💡 **Goal:** Improve connectivity by minimizing travel time and maximizing cost efficiency in road construction.
